# Twitch Live Extension v3.0.0

**_Twitch Live Extension_ 3.0.0** uses a new feature from Twitch to get Live Followed Streamers. With this, opening the extension is faster than before
and you no longer need to store the follows and press _Update Follows_.

So now, the Settings panel is cleaner, like this:

![Settings](../assets/settings_rsz.png "Settings")
![Settings Enabled](../assets/settings_enabled_rsz.png "Enabled")
