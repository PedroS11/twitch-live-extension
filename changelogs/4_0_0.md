# Twitch Live Extension v4.0.0

**_Twitch Live Extension_** will keep working in 2023!!!!!!

This new version comes without any new feature but guarantees that the extension will continue to work in 2023.
Without getting into too many details, Google changed the code standards regarding extensions, forced the developers to update their code and follow the new rules otherwise the extensions would stop working starting on 2023. 

Fortunately, I was able to adapt and make everything work. However, I know that some popular extensions might not be able because these new guidelines come with limitations that block some of their features, without a possible workaround.

If you are a developer and are interested in these new standards, here's the official [documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) and a basic [step by step](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv3-migration/) to move from the old version to the new one.
